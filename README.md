messing about with a QAPASS display on my raspi, with an adapter board attached


setting it up to display misc diagnostics and fancy lookin info that ill  
probably have attached to the bottom of my monitoir at some point


last functioning arduino application of the same functions (almost) can be found in `sketch_jul6d`. also uses a DS1302 real time clock module in that scenario to maintain time between battery replacements. some code bootlegged from `Treboda/Ds1302`.
